    # At the heart of the urllib2 module is the opener director. Whenever a
    # URL is opened, the director is responsible for locating the proper
    # handler for the protocol specified in the URL. Frequently, an existing
    # protocol handler will be subclassed and then added to the collection
    # maintained by the director. When urlopen is called, the specified
    # request is immediately handed off to the director's "open" method
    # which finds the correct handler and invokes the protocol-specific
    # XXX_open method. At least in the case of the HTTP protocols, if an
    # error occurs then the director is called again to find and invoke a
    # handler for the error; these handlers generally open a new connection
    # after adding headers to avoid the error going forward. Finally, it is
    # important to note that at the present time, the HTTP handlers in
    # urllib2 are built using a class that isn't prepared to deal with a
    # persistent connection, so they always add a "Connection: close" header
    # to the request.
    # 
    # Unfortunately, NTLM only certifies the current connection, meaning
    # that  a "Connection: keep-alive" header must be used to keep it open
    # throughout the authentication process. Furthermore, because the opener
    # director only provides a do_open method, there is no way to discover
    # the type of connection without also opening it. This means that the
    # HTTPNtlmAuthHandler cannot use the normal HTTPHandler and must
    # therefore must hardcode the HTTPConnection class. If a custom class is
    # required for whatever reason, the only way to cause it to be used is
    # to monkey-patch the code, as is done in the line above.
